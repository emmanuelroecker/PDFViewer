= PDF Viewer =

This extension open a PDF attachment file inside a Thunderbird tab.  

This extension is inspired by : 
- OpenAttachmentByExtension (https://freeshell.de//~kaosmos/index-en.html#openattach)
- Thunderbird Conversations (https://addons.thunderbird.net/fr/thunderbird/addon/gmail-conversation-view/)

This extension uses PDF.js (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js)

== How it Works ==

(after installing)

This extension detects if the user tries to open an attachement file with an extension *.pdf* and automatically
opens the PDF file inside a new Thunderbird tab using an embedded PDF Viewer rather than open it 
using the operating system default viewer.
